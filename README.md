# phpstat-tracker

learning about this:

seeing the intricacies of php is something vastly different. This project is a solid foundation for parsing the arrays given. 

The only thing difficult about this is seeing the php apart from the CSS styling. But the integration of the HTML and CSS is a good start.

I would like to see this with direct user input. instead of static, direct injected values.

Big things that I need to learn from: curl, json_decode, api keys, "end", isset, and number_format. This could be better if a search generator was embedded, and could pull up that search.
